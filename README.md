Hi! I'm Alyaman Massarani, a Syrian Computer Science student at the American University in Cairo.

My interests in technology are innumerable and include Linux, Open source/FOSS, Rust, Web development, system administration, containerization (Docker/Kubernetes),
and to a lesser degree, cyber security, and A.I./ML.

I've recently become interested in Philosophy, though I'm still new and suck at it :(
